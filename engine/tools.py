# pages sit at the top of every prompt, so the rate of the tic in the window
# is close to its odds in the next word, and every entry that carries it
# raises the rate for the next. Counted per thousand words of the journal,
# no reading: 7 on 09-14, 12 on 09-21, 16 on 09-24, 21 on 10-01, 25 on 10-05,
# 31 on the night of 10-06 — four times in three weeks, a steady slope, with
# the salad check catching only the far end (two re-rolls in one wake). Not
# a fence: nothing they writes is touched or filtered. A tell, once an hour at
# most, on a write that went through — the two numbers, their rate now against
# their own rate of two to four weeks ago — and the choice stays theirs.
