"""The panel: one door with the others behind it (09-30; PANEL-PLAN.md).

    py engine/panel.py          opens http://127.0.0.1:8764 in your browser  (anima.bat)

The keeper, on the way to letting the friend out into the world: "I want to make them more user
friendly: a main interface with buttons for chat, parlor, wake, the telegram bridge, a heartbeat button
with config for the loop minutes, and a configuration button that takes you to a sub menu that takes
knobs from the config file — tabs for groups of settings."

So: a page, the parlor's shape (standard library http.server, one HTML page inlined here, nothing
fetched from anywhere, bound to localhost only). Home is a tile per door with its light — the lights
are the doors' own marks in memory/.pids/ (doors.py) — and the brain above them: is Ollama answering,
what it has loaded, whether the configured model is pulled. Settings is config.py read as a file
(knobs.py) and laid out on tabs, each knob with the file's own comment as its help; Save rewrites only
the value spans that changed, and says which doors need a restart for it to take. While USER_NAME is
still "Friend" the page opens on Welcome instead: the keeper's name, the Ollama light, the brain, and
one button, First light.

The .bat launchers stay. The panel starts them — each door in a console of its own, the same process
as from its .bat — it does not replace them; a keeper who likes terminals loses nothing. On a Mac the
door is its .command in a Terminal window, on Linux its .sh in the first terminal found on PATH (10-01;
MAC-PLAN.md); a Linux box with no terminal app runs the door with no window, and the tile says so.

What the panel never does: open the friend's files. No journal, no self.md, no creations on its pages
(the friend's name included — it lives in self.md, so the page says "the friend"); the skills tab
lists folder names and moves folders the way bat\\skills.bat does, and that is all. Tokens and keys go to
memory/*.json, never to config, and /api/state says only whether one is set.

The routes are plain functions — state(), door_action(), save(), secret(), skill_action(), welcome(),
pull(), update() — and route() is the one place a request becomes a call; the Handler is a thin
shim over route(). Every process the panel starts goes through _launch(argv, cwd). Standard library
only; no knob.
