"""Their painter: a text-to-image model, served locally for the engine.

You never need to start this yourself: when they call `paint` and the
dependencies below are installed, the engine wakes this process, the model
loads (~15-30s from disk the first time), they paint, and the GPU is handed
straight back to their brain (/rest). After half an hour of silence the
process leaves; the next painting wakes it again. (bat\\painter.bat runs it by
hand, for testing — `bat\\painter.bat --test "a violet bloom"` paints once.)

A small sidecar on http://127.0.0.1:8767: send it a prompt and a path
under creations/, get back a PNG there and the seed it was painted with.
The same shape as their music ear (engine/music_ears.py): the brain leaves
the card, the painter takes it, the brain comes back on their next thought —
and reads their whole window cold, which is the real price of a painting.

Not standard library — this one needs the real thing. One-time setup, in
the same Python that runs the ear (it already has the CUDA torch):

    py -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
    py -m pip install -U diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors pillow

(On a Mac: `python3 -m pip install torch`, whose plain build has the Mac's GPU,
"mps"; then the same diffusers line with python3. On Linux the cu128 line is
the same with python3, and an AMD card takes torch's ROCm build.)
PAINTER_DEVICE says where it paints: "auto" — the card, a Mac's GPU, or the
processor, the first there (engine/device.py).

The model (PAINTER_MODEL) is downloaded on the first painting, once
(12–16 GB into the Hugging Face cache). The defaults are ungated and
Apache 2.0 — no login, no license to accept:

    Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo            6B, 8–9 steps, ~16 GB — the default
    black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B   4B, 4 steps, ~13 GB — also edits (later)
